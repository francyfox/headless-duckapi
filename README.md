> **headless-duckapi** turns the [duck.ai](https://duck.ai) chat (the one DuckDuckGo ships for free, no API key, no account) into a full-featured Telegram bot. It includes a **pure-JavaScript implementation of the duck.ai protocol** — including the antibot challenge solver that runs the obfuscated JS in a hand-built browser mock. No OpenAI keys, no VPS GPU, nothing to pay for.

## What you get

| | |
|---|---|
| 💬 **Streaming chat** | Answers are edited into one message live, token by token (Telegram-safe edit throttling, rollover for long texts) |
| 🤖 **Models** | GPT-5.4 mini, GPT-6 Luna, Claude Haiku 4.5, Mistral Small, GPT-OSS 120B, Gemma 4… — the list is fetched live from duck.ai with a static fallback |
| 🎨 **`/img` image generation** | duck.ai's GenerateImage tool: draft preview while it renders, then the final image as a photo, per-user daily quota |
| 📸 **Photo vision** | Send a photo (JPEG auto-re-encoded to PNG), ask about it |
| 🌐 **Web search toggle** | duck.ai's WebSearch tool, per-chat |
| 🧠 **Reasoning effort** | none / low / medium, per-chat |
| ⚙️ **Mini App** | Telegram-styled settings web app (models, effort, search, history reset) served by the bot itself |
| 📊 **/stats** | Users, sources (incl. deep-link refs and groups), daily activity, model top, duck.ai protocol health |
| 💾 **Memory** | Per-chat conversation history in SQLite, auto-pruned |
| 🦆 **Antibot-hardened** | Challenge tokens, frontend versions and solved proofs are cached in the DB to stay far away from duck.ai's 418/429 |

**Bot commands:** `/start` `/help` `/img` `/models` `/model` `/effort` `/web` `/reset` `/settings` `/stats` — plus a persistent reply-keyboard menu. On first boot the bot configures its own description, command list, menu button and avatar.

- **`bot/`** — the actual bot logic. It runs **unchanged** on both Telegram's Serverless cloud (see [`serverless/`](serverless/README.md)) and any VPS; only two lines are patched for VPS life (marked `[VPS port patch]`).
- **`platform/sdk/`** — a thin compatibility layer that implements the cloud platform's `sdk` module for Node.js: `api` → Bot API over HTTPS (with multipart file uploads), `db` → SQLite via the built-in `node:sqlite`, `fetch` → global fetch. This is what makes the same code run in both places.
- **`web/`** — the Mini App frontend. It already speaks both transports: the platform's `Serverless.call` in the cloud, and plain `POST /api/settings` with a signed `initData` header when self-hosted.

## Quick start (Docker)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/headless-duckapi.git && cd headless-duckapi
cp .env.example .env          # then put your bot token into .env
docker compose up -d --build
```

That's it — open the bot in Telegram and send `/start`. Logs: `docker compose logs -f`.

## Quick start (native)

Node.js **≥ 22.5** (24 recommended — SQLite is built in, so `npm install` brings zero dependencies):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/golaso024/headless-duckapi.git && cd headless-duckapi
npm install
cp .env.example .env          # then put your bot token into .env
node app.js
```

To keep it running like a service:

```bash
sudo cp systemd/duckai.service /etc/systemd/system/
# edit User=/WorkingDirectory=/EnvironmentFile= paths inside to match your install
sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl enable --now duckai
journalctl -u duckai -f
```

> Get the token from **@BotFather → your bot → API Token**. Use a bot token of a bot you control; don't run this and the Serverless copy on the same token at the same time (the VPS build points the webhook at itself on boot — last one started wins).

## Configuration (`.env`)

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `BOT_TOKEN` | ✅ | Bot token from @BotFather |
| `ADMIN_IDS` | — | Comma-separated Telegram user ids allowed to run `/stats`. The original author's id is baked in as a default admin — add yours |
| `WEBAPP_URL` | — | Public `https://` URL of this host for the 🎛 Настройки Mini App button. Telegram only accepts `https` there; if unset the button is hidden and `/settings` still covers everything |
| `WEBHOOK_URL` | — | Public `https://` base URL for updates; the bot registers `<WEBHOOK_URL>/api/webhook` on boot. Defaults to `WEBAPP_URL`. If neither is an `https://` URL, the bot falls back to long polling |
| `WEBHOOK_SECRET` | — | Value Telegram sends in `X-Telegram-Bot-Api-Secret-Token` (1–256 chars `A-Za-z0-9_-`); derived from `BOT_TOKEN` when empty |
| `PORT` | — | HTTP port for the Mini App/API server (default `8080`) |
| `DATA_DIR` | — | SQLite storage directory (default `./data`) |

### Webhook + Mini App over HTTPS

The bot receives updates via webhook and serves the Mini App itself, both on `PORT`. Telegram requires `https://` for webhooks and `web_app` buttons, so put a TLS proxy in front and set `WEBAPP_URL` (used for the webhook too, unless `WEBHOOK_URL` is set):

```bash
# /etc/caddy/Caddyfile — Caddy handles certificates automatically
duck.example.com {
    reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:8080
}
```

Then `WEBAPP_URL=https://duck.example.com` in `.env` and restart — the log shows `webhook set to https://duck.example.com/api/webhook`. Without an https URL the bot still works, via long polling. See [`examples/Caddyfile`](examples/Caddyfile).

### Runtime overrides (config table)

Without touching code, via the CLI (or any SQLite client on `data/duck.db`):

```bash
node app.js config set img_enabled true      # /img on/off ('false' kills it)
node app.js config set img_model gpt-6-luna  # image model (default gpt-6-luna)
node app.js config set img_daily_limit 3     # per-user daily /img quota
node app.js config list                      # everything set
node app.js setup                            # re-apply description/commands/avatar
```

## How the duck.ai protocol works

The fun part of this project — [`bot/lib/duckai.js`](bot/lib/duckai.js), ~42 KB of dependency-free JavaScript that reimplements duck.ai's client:

1. `GET /duckchat/v1/status` returns `x-vqd-hash-1`: a base64-encoded **JS challenge**.
2. The challenge is obfuscated JavaScript that fingerprints the browser (DOM parsing, `NodeList`, `window` semantics, timing). headless-duckapi solves it inside a **hand-built browser mock** (`buildBrowserMock`): an HTML5 fragment parser, real tree-walking `querySelector`, a `NodeList` class, `[object Window]` via `Symbol.toStringTag` — verified against four captured challenge flavors. The solved proof is SHA-256-hashed client-side and merged into the expected metadata shape.
3. `GET https://duck.ai/` gives the frontend version (`x-fe-version`), also cached.
4. `POST /duckchat/v1/chat` with the solved token streams the answer as SSE. Tools (web search, image generation) ride on the same stream.

Solved tokens, frontend versions and protocol counters are persisted in SQLite (`config` / `duck_daily` tables), so restarts don't re-bother the challenge endpoint — that's what keeps the bot clear of 418s/429s. Protocol originally ported from [aurora-develop/Duck2api](https://github.com/aurora-develop/Duck2api) (Go), then hardened and extended.


## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Meaning / fix |
|---|---|
| `getUpdates conflict: another getUpdates/webhook instance is running` | Polling mode only: the Serverless copy of this bot is still deployed on the same token. Stop one of them. |
| `webhook last error reported by Telegram: …` | Telegram cannot reach `<WEBHOOK_URL>/api/webhook` — check DNS, TLS and that the proxy forwards to `PORT`. |
| `Telegram auth failed: Unauthorized` | Wrong `BOT_TOKEN` — re-check @BotFather. |
| 418/429 messages in chat | duck.ai is rate-limiting; the bot retries with fresh tokens automatically. If it persists, wait a few minutes. |
| No 🎛 Настройки button in the menu keyboard | `WEBAPP_URL` is not set to an `https://` URL — see the Mini App section. |
| `headless-duckapi needs SQLite…` at boot | Your Node lacks `node:sqlite` (needs ≥ 22.5; on 22.x run `node --experimental-sqlite app.js`) and `better-sqlite3` failed to install. Upgrade Node or `npm install better-sqlite3`. |
| Bot is silent in groups | By design: privacy mode + group messages are answered on commands only. |

## Running on Telegram Serverless instead

The same bot was originally built for (and still runs on) Telegram's free Serverless platform — no VPS needed at all. The pristine cloud project lives in [`serverless/`](serverless/README.md) with deploy instructions (`tgcloud push && tgcloud migrate --safe`).
